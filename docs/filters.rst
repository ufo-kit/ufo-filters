=======
Filters
=======

Filters transform data and have at least one input and one output.


Point-based transformation
==========================

Binarization
------------

.. gobj:class:: binarize

    Binarizes an image.

    .. gobj:prop:: threshold:float

        Any values above the threshold are set to one all others to zero.


Clipping
--------

.. gobj:class:: clip

    Clip input to set minimum and maximum value.

    .. gobj:prop:: min:float

        Minimum value, all values lower than `min` are set to `min`.

    .. gobj:prop:: max:float

        Maximum value, all values higher than `max` are set to `max`.


Masking
-------

.. gobj:class:: mask

    Mask the circular outer region by setting values to zero.


Arithmetic expressions
----------------------

.. gobj:class:: calculate

    Calculate an arithmetic expression. You have access to the value stored in
    the input buffer via the *v* letter in :gobj:prop:`expression` and to the
    index of *v* via letter *x*. Please be aware that *v* is a floating point
    number while *x* is an integer. This is useful if you have multidimensional
    data and want to address only one dimension. Let's say the input is two
    dimensional, 256 pixels wide and you want to fill the x-coordinate with *x*
    for all respective y-coordinates (a gradient in x-direction). Then you can
    write *expression="x % 256"*. Another example is the *sinc* function which
    you would calculate as *expression="sin(v) / x"* for 1D input.
    For more complex math or other operations please consider using
    :ref:`OpenCL <generic-opencl-ref>`.

    .. gobj:prop:: expression:string

    many global float array parameters as connected to the filter and one
    additional as an output. For example, to compute the difference between two
    images, the kernel would look like::

        kernel void difference (global float *a, global float *b, global float *c)
        {
            size_t idx = get_global_id (1) * get_global_size (0) + get_global_id (0);

    (x, y).  When :gobj:prop:`reshape` is ``True``, the rotated image is not
    cropped, i.e.  the output image size can be larger that the input size.
    Moreover, this mode makes sure that the original coordinates of the input are
    all contained in the output so that it is easier to see the rotation in the
    output.  Try e.g.  rotation with :gobj:prop:`center` equal to :math:`(0, 0)` and

    .. gobj:prop:: height:uint

        Height of the padded image.

    .. gobj:prop:: addressing-mode:enum

        Addressing mode specifies the behavior for pixels falling outside the
        original image. See OpenCL ``sampler_t`` documentation for more information.


Cropping
--------

Stitching
---------

.. gobj:class:: stitch

    Stitches two images horizontally based on their relative given
    :gobj:prop:`shift`, which indicates how much is the second image shifted
    with respect to the first one, i.e. there is an overlapping region given by
    :math:`first\_width - shift`. First image is inserted to the stitched image
    from its left edge and the second image is inserted after the overlapping
    region. If shift is negative, the two images are swapped and stitched as
    described above with shift made positive.

    If you are stitching a 360-degree off-centered tomographic data set and
    know the axis of rotation, shift can be computed as :math:`2axis -
    second\_width` for the case the axis of rotation is greater than half of the
    first image. If it is less, then the shift is :math:`first\_width - 2 axis`.
    Moreover, you need to horizontally flip one of the images because this task
    expects images which can be stitched directly, without additional needed
    transformations.

    Stitching requires two inputs. If you want to stitch a 360-degree
    off-centered tomographic data set you can use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ufo-launch [read path=projections_left/, read path=projections_right/ ! flip direction=horizontal] ! stitch shift=N ! write filename=foo.tif

    .. gobj:prop:: shift:int

        How much is second image shifted with respect to the first one. For
        example, shift 0 means that both images overlap perfectly and the
        stitching doesn't actually broaden the image. Shift corresponding to
        image width makes for a stitched image with twice the width of the
        respective images (if they have equal width).

    .. gobj:prop:: adjust-mean:boolean

        Compute the mean of the overlapping region in the two images and adjust
        the second image to match the mean of the first one.

    .. gobj:prop:: blend:boolean

        Linearly interpolate between the two images in the overlapping region.


Multi-stream

-------------

.. gobj:class:: interpolate

    computes :math:`(1 - \alpha) s_1 + \alpha s_2` where :math:`s_1` and
    :math:`s_2` are the two input streams and :math:`\alpha` a blend factor.
    :math:`\alpha` is :math:`i / (n - 1)` for :math:`n > 1`, :math:`n` being

Reducing with OpenCL
--------------------

.. gobj:class:: opencl-reduce

    Reduces or folds the input stream using a generic OpenCL kernel by loading
    an arbitrary :gobj:prop:`kernel` from :gobj:prop:`filename` or
    :gobj:prop:`source`. The kernel must accept exactly two global float arrays,
    one for the input and one for the output. Additionally a second
    :gobj:prop:`finish` kernel can be specified which is called once when the
    processing finished. This kernel must have two arguments as well, the global
    float array and an unsigned integer count. Folding (i.e. setting the initial
    data to a known value) is enabled by setting the :gobj:prop:`fold-value`.

    Here is an OpenCL example how to compute the average::

        kernel void sum (global float *in, global float *out)
        {
            size_t idx = get_global_id (1) * get_global_size (0) + get_global_id (0);
            in[idx] += out[idx];
        }

        kernel void divide (global float *out, uint count)
        {
            size_t idx = get_global_id (1) * get_global_size (0) + get_global_id (0);
            out[idx] /= count;
        }

        The calculated center of rotation.


Sinogram offset shift
---------------------

.. gobj:class:: cut-sinogram

    Shifts the sinogram given a center not centered to the input image.

    .. gobj:prop:: center-of-rotation:float

        Center of rotation of specimen.


Phase retrieval
---------------

.. gobj:class:: retrieve-phase

    Computes and applies a fourier filter to correct phase-shifted data.
    Expects frequencies as an input and produces frequencies as an output.

    .. gobj:prop:: method:enum

        Retrieval method which is one of ``tie``, ``ctf``, ``ctfhalfsine``,
        ``qp``, ``qphalfsine`` or ``qp2``.

    .. gobj:prop:: energy:float

        Energy in keV.

    .. gobj:prop:: distance:float

        Distance in meter.

    .. gobj:prop:: pixel-size:float

        Pixel size in meter.

    .. gobj:prop:: regularization-rate:float

        Regularization parameter is log10 of the constant to be added to the
        denominator to regularize the singularity at zero frequency: 1/sin(x) ->
        1/(sin(x)+10^-RegPar).

        Typical values [2, 3].

    .. gobj:prop:: thresholding-rate:float

        Parameter for Quasiparticle phase retrieval which defines the width of
        the rings to be cropped around the zero crossing of the CTF denominator
        in Fourier space.

        Typical values in [0.01, 0.1], ``qp`` retrieval is rather independent of
        cropping width.


General matrix-matrix multiplication
====================================

.. gobj:class:: gemm

    Computes :math:`\alpha A \cdot B + \beta C` where :math:`A`, :math:`B` and :math:`C` are input
    streams 0, 1 and 2 respectively. :math:`A` must be of size :math:`m\times k`, :math:`B`
    :math:`k\times n` and :math:`C` :math:`m\times n`.

    .. note::

        This filter is only available if CLBlast support is available.

    .. gobj:prop:: alpha:float

        Scalar multiplied with :math:`AB`.

    .. gobj:prop:: beta:float

        Scalar multiplied with :math:`C`.


Segmentation
============

.. gobj:class:: segment

    Segments a stack of images given a field of labels using the random walk
    algorithm described in  [#]_. The first
    input stream must contain three-dimensional image stacks, the second input
    stream a label image with the same width and height as the images. Any pixel
    value other than zero is treated as a label and used to determine segments
    in all directions.

Auxiliary
=========

Buffering
---------

.. gobj:class:: buffer

    Buffers items internally until data stream has finished. After that all
    buffered elements are forwarded to the next task.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of pre-allocated buffers.

    .. gobj:prop:: dup-count:uint

        Number of times each image should be duplicated.

    .. gobj:prop:: loop:boolean

        Duplicates the data in a loop manner :gobj:prop:`dup-count` times.


Stamp
-----

.. gobj:class:: stamp

    Writes the current iteration into the top-left corner.

    .. gobj:prop:: font:string

        Pango font description, by default set to ``Mono 9``.

    .. gobj:prop:: scale:float

        Scales the default brightness of 1.0.

    .. note::

        This filter requires Pango and Cairo for text layouting.


Loops
-----

.. gobj:class:: loop

    Repeats output of incoming data items. It uses a low-overhead policy to
    avoid unnecessary copies. You can expect the data items to be on the device
    where the data originated.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of iterations for each received data item.


Monitoring
----------

.. gobj:class:: monitor

    Inspects a data stream and prints size, location and associated metadata
    keys on stdout.

    .. gobj:prop:: print:uint

        If set print the given numbers of items on stdout as hexadecimally
        formatted numbers.


Sleep
-----

.. gobj:class:: sleep

    Wait :gobj:prop:`time` seconds before continuing. Useful for debugging
    throughput issues.

    .. gobj:prop:: time:double

        Time to sleep in seconds.


Display
-------

.. gobj:class:: cv-show

    Shows the input using an OpenCV window.

    .. gobj:prop:: min:float

        Minimum for display value scaling. If not set, will be determined at
        run-time.

    .. gobj:prop:: max:float

        Maximum for display value scaling. If not set, will be determined at
        run-time.
