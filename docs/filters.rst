=======
Filters
=======

Filters transform data and have at least one input and one output.


Point-based transformation
==========================

Binarization
------------

.. gobj:class:: binarize

    Binarizes an image.

    .. gobj:prop:: threshold:float

        Any values above the threshold are set to one all others to zero.


Clipping
--------

.. gobj:class:: clip

    Clip input to set minimum and maximum value.

    .. gobj:prop:: min:float

        Minimum value, all values lower than `min` are set to `min`.

    .. gobj:prop:: max:float

        Maximum value, all values higher than `max` are set to `max`.


Masking
-------

.. gobj:class:: mask

    Mask the circular outer region by setting values to zero.


Arithmetic expressions
----------------------

.. gobj:class:: calculate

    Calculate an arithmetic expression. You have access to the value stored in
    the input buffer via the *v* letter in :gobj:prop:`expression` and to the
    index of *v* via letter *x*. Please be aware that *v* is a floating point
    number while *x* is an integer. This is useful if you have multidimensional
    data and want to address only one dimension. Let's say the input is two
    dimensional, 256 pixels wide and you want to fill the x-coordinate with *x*
    for all respective y-coordinates (a gradient in x-direction). Then you can
    write *expression="x % 256"*. Another example is the *sinc* function which
    you would calculate as *expression="sin(v) / x"* for 1D input.
    For more complex math or other operations please consider using
    :ref:`OpenCL <generic-opencl-ref>`.

    .. gobj:prop:: expression:string

Statistics
----------

.. gobj:class:: measure

    Measure basic image properties.

    .. gobj:prop:: metric:string

.. _generic-opencl-ref:


Generic OpenCL
--------------

.. gobj:class:: opencl

    Load an arbitrary OpenCL :gobj:prop:`kernel` from :gobj:prop:`filename` or
    :gobj:prop:`source` and execute it on each input. The kernel must accept as
    many global float array parameters as connected to the filter and one
    additional as an output. For example, to compute the difference between two
    images, the kernel would look like::

        kernel void difference (global float *a, global float *b, global float *c)
        {
            size_t idx = get_global_id (1) * get_global_size (0) + get_global_id (0);
            c[idx] = a[idx] - b[idx];
        }

    and could be used like so if defined in a file named ``diff.cl``::

        $ ufo-launch [read, read] ! opencl kernel=difference filename=diff.cl !  null

    If :gobj:prop:`filename` is not set, a default kernel file (``opencl.cl``)
    is loaded. See :ref:`opencl-default-kernels` for a list of kernel names
    defined in that file.

    .. gobj:prop:: filename:string

        OpenCL build options.

    .. gobj:prop:: dimensions:uint

        Number of dimensions the kernel works on. Must be in [1, 3].


Spatial transformation
======================

Transposition
-------------

.. gobj:class:: transpose

    Transpose images from (x, y) to (y, x).


Rotation
--------

.. gobj:class:: rotate

    Rotates images clockwise by an :gobj:prop:`angle` around a :gobj:prop:`center`
    (x, y).  When :gobj:prop:`reshape` is ``True``, the rotated image is not
    cropped, i.e.  the output image size can be larger that the input size.
    Moreover, this mode makes sure that the original coordinates of the input are
    all contained in the output so that it is easier to see the rotation in the
    output.  Try e.g.  rotation with :gobj:prop:`center` equal to :math:`(0, 0)` and
    angle :math:`\pi / 2`.

    .. gobj:prop:: angle:float

        Rotation angle in radians.

        Height of the padded image.

    .. gobj:prop:: addressing-mode:enum

        Addressing mode specifies the behavior for pixels falling outside the
        original image. See OpenCL ``sampler_t`` documentation for more information.


Cropping
--------

.. gobj:class:: crop

    Crop a region of interest from two-dimensional input. If the region is
    (partially) outside the input, only accessible data will be copied.

    .. gobj:prop:: x:uint

Cutting
-------

.. gobj:class:: cut

    it is the opposite of crop.

    .. gobj:prop:: width:uint

        Width of the region to cut out.


Tiling
------

.. gobj:class:: tile

    Cuts input into multiple tiles. The stream contains tiles in a zig-zag
    pattern, i.e. the first tile starts at the top left corner of the input goes
    on the same row until the end and continues on the first tile of the next
    row until the final tile in the lower right corner.

    .. gobj:prop:: width:uint

        Width of a tile which must be a divisor of the input width. If this is
        not changed, the full width will be used.

    .. gobj:prop:: height:uint

        Width of a tile which must be a divisor of the input height. If this is
        not changed, the full height will be used.


Swapping quadrants
------------------

.. gobj:class:: swap-quadrants

    Cuts the input into four quadrants and swaps the lower right with the upper
    left and the lower left with the upper right quadrant.


Polar transformation
--------------------

.. gobj:class:: polar-coordinates

    Transformation between polar and cartesian coordinate systems.

    When transforming from cartesian to polar coordinates the origin is in the
    image center (:gobj:prop:`width` / 2, :gobj:prop:`height` / 2).  When
    transforming from polar to cartesian coordinates the origin is in the image
    corner (0, 0).

    .. gobj:prop:: height:uint

        Final height after transformation.

    .. gobj:prop:: direction: string

Stitching
---------

.. gobj:class:: stitch

    Stitches two images horizontally based on their relative given
    :gobj:prop:`shift`, which indicates how much is the second image shifted
    with respect to the first one, i.e. there is an overlapping region given by
    :math:`first\_width - shift`. First image is inserted to the stitched image
    from its left edge and the second image is inserted after the overlapping
    region. If shift is negative, the two images are swapped and stitched as
    described above with shift made positive.

    If you are stitching a 360-degree off-centered tomographic data set and
    know the axis of rotation, shift can be computed as :math:`2axis -
    second\_width` for the case the axis of rotation is greater than half of the
    first image. If it is less, then the shift is :math:`first\_width - 2 axis`.
    Moreover, you need to horizontally flip one of the images because this task
    expects images which can be stitched directly, without additional needed
    transformations.

    Stitching requires two inputs. If you want to stitch a 360-degree
    off-centered tomographic data set you can use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        ufo-launch [read path=projections_left/, read path=projections_right/ ! flip direction=horizontal] ! stitch shift=N ! write filename=foo.tif

    .. gobj:prop:: shift:int

        How much is second image shifted with respect to the first one. For
        example, shift 0 means that both images overlap perfectly and the
        stitching doesn't actually broaden the image. Shift corresponding to
        image width makes for a stitched image with twice the width of the
        respective images (if they have equal width).

    .. gobj:prop:: adjust-mean:boolean

        Compute the mean of the overlapping region in the two images and adjust
        the second image to match the mean of the first one.

    .. gobj:prop:: blend:boolean

        Linearly interpolate between the two images in the overlapping region.


Multi-stream
============

Interpolation
-------------

.. gobj:class:: interpolate

    Interpolates incoming data from two compatible streams, i.e.  the task
    computes :math:`(1 - \alpha) s_1 + \alpha s_2` where :math:`s_1` and
    :math:`s_2` are the two input streams and :math:`\alpha` a blend factor.
    :math:`\alpha` is :math:`i / (n - 1)` for :math:`n > 1`, :math:`n` being
    :gobj:prop:`number` and :math:`i` the current iteration.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of total output stream length.


.. gobj:class:: interpolate-stream

    Interpolates between elements from an incoming stream.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of total output stream length.


Subtract
--------

.. gobj:class:: subtract

    Subtract data items of the second from the first stream.


Correlate
---------

.. gobj:class:: correlate-stacks

    Reads two datastreams, the first must provide a 3D stack of images that is
    used to correlate individal 2D images from the second datastream. The
    ``number`` property must contain the expected number of items in the second
    stream.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of data items in the second data stream.


Filters
=======

Median
------

.. gobj:class:: median-filter

    Filters input with a simple median.

    .. gobj:prop:: size:uint

        Odd-numbered size of the neighbouring window.


Edge detection
--------------

.. gobj:class:: detect-edge

    Detect edges by computing the power gradient image using different edge
    filters.

    .. gobj:prop:: filter:enum

        Edge filter (or operator) which is one of ``sobel``, ``laplace`` and
        ``prewitt``. By default, the ``sobel`` operator is used.



Gaussian blur
-------------

.. gobj:class:: blur

    Blur image with a gaussian kernel.

    .. gobj:prop:: size:uint

        Size of the kernel.

    .. gobj:prop:: sigma:float

        Sigma of the kernel.


Gradient
--------

.. gobj:class:: gradient

    Compute gradient.

    .. gobj:prop:: direction:enum

         Direction of the gradient, can be either ``horizontal``, ``vertical``,
         ``both`` or ``both_abs``.


Non-local-means denoising
-------------------------

.. gobj:class:: non-local-means

    Reduce noise using Buades' non-local means algorithm.

    .. gobj:prop:: search-radius:uint

        Radius for similarity search.

    .. gobj:prop:: patch-radius:uint

        Radius of patches.

    .. gobj:prop:: h:float

        Smoothing control parameter, should be around noise standard deviation
        or slightly less. Higher h results in a smoother image but with blurred
        features. If it is 0, estimate noise standard deviation and use it as
        the parameter value.

    .. gobj:prop:: sigma:float

        Noise standard deviation, improves weights computation. If it is zero,
        it is *not* automatically estimated as opposed to :gobj:prop:`h`.
        :gobj:prop:`estimate-sigma` has to be specified in order to override
        :gobj:prop:`sigma` value.

    .. gobj:prop:: window:boolean

        Apply Gaussian profile with :math:`\sigma = \frac{P}{2}`, where :math:`P`
        is the :gobj:prop:`patch-radius` parameter to the weight computation
        which decreases the influence of pixels towards the corners of the
        patches.

    .. gobj:prop:: fast:boolean

        Use a fast version of the algorithm described in [#]_. The only
        difference in the result from the classical algorithm is that there is
        no Gaussian profile used and from the nature of the fast algorithm,
        floating point precision errors might occur for large images.

    .. gobj:prop:: estimate-sigma:boolean

        Estimate sigma based on [#]_, which overrides :gobj:prop:`sigma`
        parameter value. Only the first image in a sequence is used for
        estimation and the estimated sigma is re-used for every consequent
        image.

    .. gobj:prop:: addressing-mode:enum

        Addressing mode specifies the behavior for pixels falling outside the
        original image. See OpenCL ``sampler_t`` documentation for more information.

Finding large spots
-------------------

.. gobj:class:: find-large-spots

    Find large spots with extreme values in an image. First, pixels with values
    greater than :gobj:prop:`spot_threshold` are added to the mask, then
    connected pixels with absolute difference between them and the originally
    detected greater than :gobj:prop:`grow-threshold` are added to the mask. In
    the end, holes are also removed from the mask.

    .. gobj:prop:: spot-threshold:float

        Pixels with values greater than this threshold are added to the mask.

    .. gobj:prop:: grow-threshold:float

        Pixels connected to the ones found by :gobj:prop:`spot-threshold` with
        absolute difference greater than this threshold are added to the mask.
        If the value is 0, it is automatically set to full width at tenth
        maximum of the estimated noise standard deviation.

    .. gobj:prop:: addressing-mode:enum

        Addressing mode specifies the behavior for pixels falling outside the
        original image. See OpenCL ``sampler_t`` documentation for more
        information. This parameter is used only for automatic noise standard
        deviation estimation.



Horizontal interpolation
------------------------

.. gobj:class:: horizontal-interpolate

    Interpolate masked values in rows of an image. For all pixels equal to one
    in the mask, find the closest pixel where mask is zero to the left and right
    and linearly interpolate the value in the current pixel based on the found
    left and right values. If the mask goes to the left or right border of the
    image and on the other side there are at least two non-masked pixels
    :math:`x_1` and :math:`x_2`, compute the value in the current pixel
    :math:`x` by (in case the mask goes to the right border, left is analogous)
    :math:`f(x) = f(x_2) + (x - x_2) * (f(x_2) - f(x_1))`. In case there is only
    one valid pixel on one of the borders and all the others are masked, use
    that pixel's value in all the remaining ones.


Stream transformations
======================

Averaging
---------

.. gobj:class:: average

    Read in full data stream and generate an averaged output.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of averaged images to output. By default one image is generated.


Reducing with OpenCL
--------------------

.. gobj:class:: opencl-reduce

    Reduces or folds the input stream using a generic OpenCL kernel by loading
    an arbitrary :gobj:prop:`kernel` from :gobj:prop:`filename` or
    :gobj:prop:`source`. The kernel must accept exactly two global float arrays,
    one for the input and one for the output. Additionally a second
    :gobj:prop:`finish` kernel can be specified which is called once when the
    processing finished. This kernel must have two arguments as well, the global
    float array and an unsigned integer count. Folding (i.e. setting the initial
    data to a known value) is enabled by setting the :gobj:prop:`fold-value`.

    Here is an OpenCL example how to compute the average::

        kernel void sum (global float *in, global float *out)
        {
            size_t idx = get_global_id (1) * get_global_size (0) + get_global_id (0);
            out[idx] += in[idx];
        }

        kernel void divide (global float *out, uint count)
        {
            size_t idx = get_global_id (1) * get_global_size (0) + get_global_id (0);
            out[idx] /= count;
        }

    And this is how you would use it with ``ufo-launch``::

        ufo-launch ... ! opencl-reduce kernel=sum finish=divide ! ...

    If :gobj:prop:`filename` is not set, a default kernel file is loaded. See
    :ref:`opencl-reduction-default-kernels` for a list of possible kernels.

    .. gobj:prop:: filename:string

        Filename with kernel sources to load.

    .. gobj:prop:: source:string

        String with OpenCL kernel code.

    .. gobj:prop:: kernel:string

        Name of the kernel that is called on each iteration. Must have two
        global float array arguments, the first being the input, the second the
        output.

    .. gobj:prop:: finish:string

        Name of the kernel that is called at the end after all iterations. Must
        have a global float array and an unsigned integer arguments, the first
        being the data, the second the iteration counter.

    .. gobj:prop:: fold-value:float

        If given, the initial data is filled with this value, otherwise the
        first input element is used.

    .. gobj:prop:: dimensions:uint

        Number of dimensions the kernel works on. Must be in [1, 3].

Statistics
----------

.. gobj:class:: flatten

    Flatten input stream by reducing with operation based on the given mode.

    .. gobj:prop:: mode:string

        Operation, can be either ``min``, ``max``, ``sum`` and ``median``.

    Faster inplace operating variant of the ``flatten`` task.

    .. gobj:prop:: mode:enum

         Operation, can be either ``min``, ``max`` and ``sum``.


Slicing
-------

.. gobj:class:: slice

    Slices a three-dimensional input buffer to two-dimensional slices.


Stacking
--------

.. gobj:class:: stack

    Symmetrical to the slice filter, the stack filter stacks two-dimensional
    input. If ``number`` is not a divisor of the number of input images, the
    last produced stack at index which starts to exceed the number of input
    images will contain arbitrary images from the previous iterations.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of items, i.e. the length of the third dimension.


Stacking with sliding window
----------------------------

.. gobj:class:: sliding-stack

    Stacks input images up to the specified :gobj:prop:`number` and then
    replaces old images with incoming new ones as they come. The first image is
    copied to all positions in the beginning. By default, images in the window
    are not ordered, i.e. if e.g. :gobj:prop:`number` = 3, then the window will
    contain the following input images: (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 2), (3, 1,
    2), (3, 4, 2), (3, 4, 5) and so on. If you want them to appear ordered with
    respect to their arrival time, use :gobj:prop:`ordered`.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of items, i.e. the length of the third dimension.

    .. gobj:prop:: ordered:boolean

        Order items in the sliding window.


Merging
-------

.. gobj:class:: merge

    Merges the data from two or more input data streams into a single data
    stream by concatenation.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of input streams. By default this is two.


Slice mapping
-------------

.. gobj:class:: map-slice

    Lays out input images on a quadratic grid. If the :gobj:prop:`number` of
    input elements is not the square of some integer value, the next higher
    number is chosen and the remaining data is blackened.

    .. gobj:prop:: number:uint

        Number of expected input elements. If more elements are sent to the
        mapper, warnings are issued.


Color mapping
-------------

.. gobj:class:: map-color

    Receives a two-dimensional image and maps its gray values to three red,
    green and blue color channels using the Viridis color map.


Splitting channels
------------------

.. gobj:class:: unsplit

    Turns a three-dimensional image into two-dimensional image by interleaving
    the third dimension, i.e. [[[XXX],[YYY],[ZZZ]]] is turned into
    [[XYZ],[XYZ],[XYZ]]. This is useful to merge a separate multi-channel RGB
    image into a "regular" RGB image that can be shown with ``cv-show``.

    This task adds the ``channels`` key to the output buffer containing the
    original depth of the input buffer.


Fourier domain
==============

Fast Fourier transform
----------------------

.. gobj:class:: fft

    Compute the Fourier spectrum of input data. If :gobj:prop:`dimensions` is one
    but the input data is 2-dimensional, the 1-D FFT is computed for each row.

    .. gobj:prop:: auto-zeropadding:boolean

        Automatically zeropad input data to a size to the next power of 2.

    .. gobj:prop:: dimensions:uint

        Size of FFT transform in z-direction.


.. gobj:class:: ifft

    Compute the inverse Fourier of spectral input data. If
    :gobj:prop:`dimensions` is one but the input data is 2-dimensional, the 1-D
    FFT is computed for each row.

    .. gobj:prop:: dimensions:uint

Frequency filtering

    effectively attenuating certain frequencies.

    .. gobj:prop:: filter :enum

        Any of ``ramp``, ``ramp-fromreal``, ``butterworth``, ``faris-byer``,
        ``hamming`` and ``bh3`` (Blackman-Harris-3). The default filter is
        ``ramp-fromreal`` which computes a correct ramp filter avoiding offset
        issues encountered with naive implementations.

    .. gobj:prop:: scale:float

        Arbitrary scale that is multiplied to each frequency component.

    .. gobj:prop:: cutoff:float

Stripe filtering
----------------

.. gobj:class:: filter-stripes

    Filter vertical stripes. The input and output are in 2D frequency domain.
    The filter multiplies horizontal frequencies (for frequency ky=0) with a
    Gaussian profile centered at 0 frequency if ``vertical-sigma`` is 0.
    Otherwise it applies also a vertical Gaussian profile (1 - Gaussian), which
    enables filtering of not perfectly vertical stripes, which is useful for
    broader stripes and stripes which are not perfectly straight.

    Example usage::

        $ ufo-launch read path=sino.tif ! fft dimensions=2 ! filter-stripes sigma=1 ! ifft dimensions=2 ! write filename=sino-filtered.tif

    .. gobj:prop:: horizontal-sigma:float

        Horizontal filter strength, which is the sigma of the Gaussian. Small
        values, e.g. 1e-7 cause only the zero frequency to remain in the
        signal, i.e. stronger filtering. Values around 1 are a good starting
        point.

    .. gobj:prop:: vertical-sigma:float

        Vertical filter strength, which is the sigma of the Gaussian. The larger
        the value, the more non-vertical frequencies are removed. Value around 4
        is a good starting point.


1D stripe filtering
-------------------

.. gobj:class:: filter-stripes1d

    Filter stripes in 1D along the x-axis. The input and output are in frequency
    domain. The filter multiplies the frequencies with an inverse Gaussian
    profile centered at 0 frequency. The inversed profile means that the filter
    is f(k) = 1 - gauss(k) in order to suppress the low frequencies.

    .. gobj:prop:: strength:float

        Filter strength, which is the full width at half maximum of the
